# Wit.ai Bot Engine with stories working with hubot

This week Facebook announced together with wit.ai their new strategy on bots. Microsoft did a similar move two weeks ago and I must say this is very inspiring technology. We have an instance of rocket.chat, an open source slack alternative running in our company and I wanted to give this a try. We already had a hubot running but to be honest, it's not very user friendly. It's just like Siri or OK Google where you have to know the exact commands to trigger something. As an example you have to say: Alfred weather Munich to get a forecast coming from a script. If you said Alfred what's the weather in Munich it wouldn't work because it only responds to the correct trigger. There's a list of commands when you call Alfred help but that list is extensive and not very user friendly. 

wit.ai now does the natural language understanding magic. LUIS
