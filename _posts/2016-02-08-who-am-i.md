New interactions will turn industries upside down"
My name ist Gabor Wraight, I am a technologist. Currently working as Design Technology Manager for Phoenixdesign in Munich.
In my team we consult global clients such as Audi, BMW, Bosch, Samsung, Huawei and NovoNordisk. We develop innovation strategies together with our clients. I am an avid Early Adopter of any type of electronic gadget. I am not a nerd, I am a geek.
After freelancing for twelve years as a software developer I started working full time for Designit, a global strategic design firm. From here on I worked with Designers from all over the world on a daily basis. I would now consider myself a technology designer.
My Specialties are: Creative Technology, Trends, User Experience, Retail Experience, High Resolution Powerwalls, Gesture Interaction, Prototype Development, Product Service Experience, Adobe Certified Expert
