Remix OS is a x86 Based Android Operating System built for PC. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4981c2db-17d1-4c13-ae9a-8dc437526832.png)

The guys from [jide.com][0] managed to give Android a Desktop look & feel by adding a file manager, a taskbar, right-click, notification and so much more. You can make a bootable USB stick which you can carry with you to boot whatever computer you want into your Remix OS. If you want you can of course also install it natively on you machine.

I made the effort and managed to now tripple boot my macbook with Mac OS, Windows 10 and Remix OS..
